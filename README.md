The token was created by myself Chris Penman. There are no other team members or investors at this time. 
I am a real person, a structural engineer and Amazon bestselling author.

FOODBANK is a token which gives funds to foodbanks and gives rewards and profit to you. 

We all invest in crypto with the dream for our family of one day having a huge house and a Lambo, 
but what if your dream for your family is not one of huge houses and Lambo’s but one of Hotdogs and lasagne?
What if all you want right now, is to be able to feed your kids?

FOODBANK is a token  which gives money to local foodbanks. And I don’t mean local to me, I mean local to you! No more investing in tokens to see funds go to far off lands. 
If you’re one of the major investors in this token then we’ll funnel funds to your local foodbank, so you can see the difference you’re making first hand.
